# How to Run the code

1. Download the cooperhewitt-image-dataset using the following link
    Get the cooperhewitt pre-processed dataset from here:
https://utexas-my.sharepoint.com/personal/ctm2723_my_utexas_edu/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fctm2723%5Fmy%5Futexas%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2Fcooperhewitt%2Dimage%2Ddataset%2Ezip&parent=%2Fpersonal%2Fctm2723%5Fmy%5Futexas%5Fedu%2FDocuments&ga=1

2. Run all the cells in jupyter notebook namely `text_generation_llm_fine_tuning.ipynb`. This will train the model and give all the evaluation metrics after predictions.
