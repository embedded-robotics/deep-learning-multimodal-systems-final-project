# Descriptive Image Captioning using Vision and Language Models

This repository deals with fine-tuning of large large models to predict the captions of images given the image as well as the short captions describing the image.

Other part of the project available here: https://github.com/ct-martin/dlmm-final-project

1. Get the cooperhewitt pre-processed dataset as instructed here: https://github.com/ct-martin/dlmm-final-project

2. Run all the cells in jupyter notebook namely `text_generation_llm_fine_tuning.ipynb`. This will train the model and give all the evaluation metrics after predictions.
